# List-Pokemon-With-React

## Description
This is a react app that pulls pokemon from the PokeApi(https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon) and lists them on the page.

### Changes I made to the app
- I pulled data from the PokeApi and liste the first 20 pokemon on 2 paginated pages.
- I got rid of the search bar and the submit button since I am just listing the itmes
- I used bootstrap to style the list elements

## How To Run
visit https://glaldaz.github.io/List-Pokemon-With-React/ to run the app.

## Future Improvements
- Add mor information per pokemon, like the sprite, and height and weight and signature move
- Style the page more to add color and logos
- add a longer list of pokemon, the api limits the number pulled by default, but I could put more work into getting more pokemon.
- Add ability to change how many pokemon display per page
